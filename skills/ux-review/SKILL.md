# Perform a user-centered UX review

Use for reviews, audits, critique and issue triage **without assuming permission to change code**.

Read `references/evidence-and-priority.md` when you need to grade evidence, resolve conflicting interpretations, or rank complex findings.

1. Identify audience, task goals, critical journeys, product constraints, responsive modes and available evidence. If artifacts exist, inspect them; don't guess from descriptions that conflict with artifacts.
2. Walk the journey in goal order: entry, locate, decide, act, wait, errors/recovery, completion, return. For each observed failure, apply the taxonomy from `../ux-diagnose/references/issue_taxonomy.json` and the relevant domain playbook.
3. Inspect cross-cutting accessibility, semantics, keyboard/motion, loading/error states and trust. Keep aesthetics separate from usability. Do not claim WCAG conformance from a screenshot.
4. Report only substantiated or clearly marked hypothesized findings. Record exact screen/component or step and concrete expected-versus-actual behavior. Limit each finding to 1 primary class + up to 2 supporting laws when possible.
5. Rank by user harm (including low-frequency severe harms), observed frequency, persistence and recovery cost. Separate fixes that remove the cause from visual patches.
6. For each finding: proposed change, tradeoff, and a measurable/observable acceptance check. Offer quick wins and systemic changes without pretending untested suggestions are validated.

Default output: a short executive diagnosis, then an ordered issue table with `ID, evidence, location, user impact, primary class, law, severity, confidence, fix, validation`. Do not produce counts or decorative scores merely to signal thoroughness. If the user requested JSON, use the issue-record schema. Cite the exact law URL when relying on it.
