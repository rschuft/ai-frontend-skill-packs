description: Classify visual aesthetic and composition problems in frontend screenshots, design systems, pages or components using Digital Polo design principles, color theory, typography, visual hierarchy, Gestalt, spacing and brand direction. Use when a UI looks off, amateurish, cluttered, visually inconsistent or unpolished.

# Diagnose visual design issues

Use **visual evidence first**, not taste labels. This skill explains *why* a composition does not convey the intended message. If an observed issue is primarily interaction friction route to `ux-diagnose`; if it is an accessibility barrier route to `wcag21-diagnose` too.

## Procedure
1. Record the surface and audience, user task, design intent, brand constraints, viewport/theme, and observations. Do not infer click behavior, responsive failures or screen-reader behavior from one image.
2. Load `references/issue_taxonomy.json`: select **one primary** of ten practical repair categories and zero to two secondary ones. Use `references/principles.json` to associate at most three of the original seven composition principles. `references/elements.json` helps describe the material causing the issue (color, texture, space, etc.).
3. Distinguish symptoms from mechanism: for example, "CTA disappears against photo" -> hierarchy/contrast or image treatment, **not** automatically a color-theory problem. Compare alternatives using the appropriate article summary in `references/articles.json` and Gestalt concepts where relevant.
4. Read `references/cross_principle_conflicts.json` for at least one relevant tradeoff. Filter `references/remediation_recipes.json` to matching category/observation. Load only the matching `design-*` specialist's `references/playbook.md` when implementing.
5. Propose the smallest coherent repair that preserves the underlying user task. Test at relevant widths/themes, through grayscale, with real copy and content length. Never claim a design "fails" a subjective principle as if it were a technical standard.

## Evidence grades and prioritization
- **Confirmed:** screenshot or browser/code observation directly supports the issue; observational limits explicitly stated.
- **Hypothesis:** design mechanism inferred; discriminate with a screen comparison, brief check, measured contrast or user test.
- Prioritize a blocked task or inaccessible content over a weak aesthetic; after those, prioritize task-relevant salience, reproducible confusion and cross-screen visual drift over personal preference.

## Output
`finding ID | observed symptom | evidence/uncertainty | primary category | relevant design principle(s) | user/brand impact | smallest repair | competing tradeoff | acceptance test`. For machine-readable records use `references/finding.schema.json`.

## Boundaries
Digital Polo articles provide design heuristics, not normative accessibility standards. User goals, truthful interface state, consent and applicable WCAG criteria outrank aesthetic optimization. If appropriate, activate `ux-*` and `wcag21-*` alongside this skill. Do not bulk-load the whole article catalog into output.
