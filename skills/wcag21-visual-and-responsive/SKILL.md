# Visual presentation and responsive behavior

**Trigger:** Color, text and graphical contrast, responsive reflow, zoom, spacing, hover. **Diagnosis question:** Does the UI become illegible or lose content when perception or presentation changes?

Base WCAG 2.1 criteria: **1.3.4, 1.4.1, 1.4.3, 1.4.4, 1.4.5, 1.4.6, 1.4.8, 1.4.9, 1.4.10, 1.4.11, 1.4.12, 1.4.13**. See the detailed operational guidance in `references/playbook.md`. For every targeted SC, read the matching entry in the selected `../wcag21-diagnose/references/criteria-2.2.json` or `../wcag21-diagnose/references/criteria.json`, including its normative link, applicability/exception warning and method. A standard's original text always prevails over these notes.

## Procedure

1. Reproduce observed barrier on actual page/component, state, input modality and user task. Distinguish a confirmed fail from suspected fail or non-applicable SC.
2. Use playbook differential diagnosis to choose the specific requirement, not a catch-all accessibility label. Consult `../wcag21-diagnose/references/cross_criterion_conflicts.json` when several SCs appear related.
3. Implement the smallest robust remediation, preferring native semantics and accessible functionality over superficial ARIA or test suppression. Check normal, focused, disabled, loading and error states relevant to this feature.
4. Verify with criterion-specific steps from the catalog and playbook, including manual/assistive-technology checks where required. Record evidence and browser/AT context; automated tool output alone is not WCAG conformance proof.
5. For comprehensive review use `wcag21-review`; for implementation orchestration use `wcag21-build`; for post-change assurance use `wcag21-validate`.

## Failure discipline

Differentiate minimum text contrast, non-text contrast, AAA contrast and user spacing override. Never label an item as a failure under the selected WCAG version from visual appearance alone when behavioral evidence is required. Distinguish A/AA/AAA and applicability exceptions. Report exact user harm, criterion ID, practical repair and test. Do not assert legal compliance.


## WCAG version selection (required)

Before classifying a normative failure, resolve **standard + level** according to `../wcag21-diagnose/references/standard-selection.md`. Precedence: explicit task/contract > consuming-project `.frontend-a11y.json` or unambiguous project policy > **WCAG 2.2 AA**. Record the chosen version and level. Read `../wcag21-diagnose/references/standards.json` and the versioned criterion catalog through `wcag21-diagnose` (2.2: `criteria-2.2.json`; 2.1: `criteria.json`). Never apply 2.2-only criteria to 2.1; never test 4.1.1 Parsing in 2.2. **WCAG 3.0** is an opt-in, dated Working Draft research lens only; its guidance is never an active 2.x conformance criterion. If project sources conflict, disclose and resolve before a conformance statement.

**WCAG 2.2 additions relevant to visual UI:** 2.4.11 AA focus not fully obscured, 2.4.12 AAA fully visible, 2.4.13 AAA measured focus appearance, and 2.5.8 AA pointer target geometry. Delegate primary functional tests to focus/pointer specialists.
