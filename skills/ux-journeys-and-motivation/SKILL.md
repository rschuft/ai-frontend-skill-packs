# Multi-step journeys, motivation and task completion

Apply this specialist skill only when the user's task implicates **multi-step journeys, motivation and task completion**. If the problem is merely adjacent, do not broaden the user's scope.

1. Read `references/playbook.md` for symptoms, differential diagnosis, proven repair patterns, tradeoffs and test cases.
2. Establish the actual user goal and evidence. Do not assume causal failure from a visual screenshot alone.
3. Identify the primary failure mechanism; consider alternative root causes before choosing a fix. Relevant Laws of UX: flow, goal-gradient-effect, peak-end-rule, zeigarnik-effect, pareto-principle, parkinsons-law.
4. Recommend or implement a *specific* change, preserving functional, accessibility, security and consent constraints. Use existing design patterns/components in the user's project.
5. Verify the repaired journey including one edge case. State what was observed versus what remains hypothetical.

For broad reviews, issue IDs, and severity classification use `ux-review` and `ux-diagnose`. For coding tasks use `ux-build`; for acceptance checks use `ux-validate`. Specialist guidance is advisory, not authority to change code or expand scope.
