# Imbalanced visual mass or implausible image-to-text ratios

Use this specialist when the actual task involves balance issues. Check documented brand/system decisions before prescribing changes. Do not conflate taste with accessibility standards or make assumptions from screenshots alone.

## When to load
Affecting category: **balance**. Related governing principles: balance, proportion. Route from `design-diagnose` or `design-review` when observations match this category, or load directly during a focused implementation.

## First-pass remediation inventory
- **lopsided-hero**: Reduce media area or saturation, move focal content, add counterweight via spatial grouping. Verify: At three responsive widths the hero conveys intended priority and does not collapse.
- **ratio-inconsistency**: Choose documented ranges for proportions; constrain with min/max not rigid ratios; align to content priority. Verify: Test compact and expanded data; sidebar remains useful and content readable.
- **asymmetry-unintended**: Check whether intentional asymmetry supports focal point; if not redistribute density or move supporting elements. Verify: Review paired wide/narrow compositions with intended hierarchy stated.

Read `references/playbook.md` for exact discriminating checks, implementation examples, tradeoffs and acceptance tests. Keep the fix within the existing component architecture. Report original observation, selected recipe and evidence. For usability, engage `ux-*`; for normative accessibility, engage `wcag-*`.
